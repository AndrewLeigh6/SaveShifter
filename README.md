## Save Shifter

It lets you transfer saved posts from one reddit account to another

### Todo

- Add filters so you can see all your saved posts, and then filter them down to just posts from certain subs
- Tidy up the UI and make it look not horrible
- Move the render functions into their own components
- Work out why the remove posts button only seems to start removing posts after you click it a second time


### Maybe todo

- Replace insane state logic with reducers
- Replace insane render logic with react router
- Replace insane auth logic with just a username / password login for each account
